A few years ago, a friend needed some help integrating Twilio with a Delphi 2007 program. I took a look at the [sample code from Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/docs/messaging/tutorials/how-to-send-sms-messages-delphi), written with Delphi 10.2 Tokyo and realized it would take a bunch of work to downgrade it for the older version of Delphi. So I wrote a DLL and showed him how to call it from his program--and it worked. He didn't end up using Twilio after all but I posted the code here in case I or anyone else ever needed it.

This DLL was written in **Delphi 10.4** but the code is probably compatible back to 10 Seattle.

Another friend had a nearly identical need today and so I looked up my original work with Twilio and found I had neglected to upload the demo programs I had written--those, along with the original .DLL is now part of this repository.

I hope someone finds it useful.
